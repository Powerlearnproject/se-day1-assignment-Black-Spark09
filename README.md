#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, concepts, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming languages: The development of Programming languages heralded a new era for it because it made it much more to easier to relate with computers
2. Becoming a Discipline of its own in the 1960's: This highlighted it's growth as a formidable Branch of computer science 
3. The advent of Structured Programming in the 1970's Kick-started software engineering in a much more structured and organized way

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: This involves putting together all the necessary data and needs of the user and the system's requirements 
2. Design: This is the phase where the plans for the software architecture and it's UI is are made.
3. Implementation: is the phase where the actual deed(software development) is performed according the design made in phase 2.
4. Testing: is to ascertain the newly created software's required functionality and making sure it meets quality standards.
5. Deployment: refers to the release of the software to it's end users or customers.
6. Maintainance: involves updating, enhancing, and issuing support to the software after deployment 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Comparing: I think even with their distinct approach they're both geared towards achieving a common aim, which is to create a good and efficient software and they're also both made in a way that makes updates easy to implement as they're both built based on frameworks.
Contrasting: I'd say the Waterfall method tends to  drive towards what I call the petit-a-petit(step by step)method to achieve it's objective whereas the Agile method pushes towards an out-of-the-box means it doesn't solely depend on steps but works based on random prompts
Let's take for example if you're settling up a software for online trading you going to need to use a step by step process as u have to outline payment methods, refund policies etc but in the case of a software that is meant to serve as a live chatting space you're more open to the use of random ideas although you still need to stick to a framework and that's where we talk about the Agile method 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is the one responsible for writing the programs and managing its testing.
A quality assurance engineer is the one who ensures the quality of the software and develops it's test plans.
A project manager as the name implies is the one who manages the building, planning and distribution of the software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's make it easier for developers to write, debug and test codes all in a single software without having to keep going back and forth i.e Visual studio code
VCS makes collaboration easier for developers and aids efficient development when working as a team. and example includes GitHub 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements: The engineer could add extra charges for any changes in already submitted requirements as that would prod the customers into making full decisions before approaching the developer.
Tight deadline: depends on the engineer but I feel if as a developer I can't deliver my best within a given timeframe then I'd rather not take the job as if the job turns out to be a disaster,no one would want to listen to your excuse and the end of the day u get labeled incompetent 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing bit-by-bit whereas integration testing involves testing a group of those bits or components 
The system testing is the testing of the whole software system to ensure its efficiency while the acceptance testing is primarily done to ascertain if the software meets the prescribed requirements 

They are important because they help the developer in identitying and flaws or something he must have got wrong in the process of writing the codes. it also aids the overall team in knowing if the software is able to meet users requirements 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering refers to the ability to craft questions or statements that are able to elicit the best possible answers from AI models. It is important because it helps us in getting a more detailed, polished and elaborate answers from AI models and it tends to additionally bring out results to suit a specific context 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Where is Futminna located?
Improved prompt: You're my tour guide. i want to know where futminna is with a clear description of how to travel there, what to expect and How much it will cost to get there by air
Reason for the improved prompt: it gives a clear oversight on the specific details that the user needs and the information he requires to get to where he is asking about
